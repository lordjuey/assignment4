# simple JavaScript Quiz using vanilla javascript .
first I made different HTML pages , each javascript files to go with it and one css file to be shared.
had issues with quiz.js file the answers were running multiple times , suspected errors from array. 

saving highscore still does not 100% work , can't think of ways to get it work at the moment . 
thanks
